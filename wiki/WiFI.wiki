Compile linux kernel & wireless tool.

Power-on & boot linux 

Insert Silex SDIO WiFI on J64

Load device driver module by insmod ath6kl_sdio.ko

Connect AP by iwconfig wlan0 essid 'apname'

Set IP Address by ifconfig wlan0 192.168.0.10

= Caution =
Only SDIO thru MIO is used to connect Silex SX-SDCAN WiFI.

Because clock speed of SDIO thru EMIO is limited.
(Refer to http://forums.xilinx.com/t5/Embedded-Processor-System-Design/Zynq-SDIO-via-EMIO/td-p/327479)

Also, Silex SX-SDCAN is not working when SDHCI High-speed is disabled.
(My experiment shows that device driver is not working)
