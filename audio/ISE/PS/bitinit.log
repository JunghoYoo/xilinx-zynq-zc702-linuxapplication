INFO:EDK:1432 - Frequency for Top-Level Input Clock
   'processing_system7_0_PS_CLK_pin' is not specified. Clock DRCs will not be
   performed for IPs connected to that clock port, unless they are connected
   through the clock generator IP.

INFO:EDK - INFO: DDR Base and High address in current configuration is
   0x00000000 and 0x3FFFFFFF respectively. 
INFO:EDK - INFO: You can modify the DDR address range accessed by Programmable
   Logic through the processing_system7 AXI slave interfaces. If MicroBlaze is a
   master on processing_system7 AXI slave interfaces, please use the top half of
   the address range (Base Address = 0x20000000; High Address = 0x3FFFFFFF). For
   all other master, any subset of the DDR address can be used. See Xilinx
   Answer 47167 for more information.
